## Step 2: The Projects and Teams

After you have been added to the GitHub Organization, you can take a look at all repositories to see which project sparks your interest.

### Teams

Currently, we have **8 teams** working on different projects and a product/project manager. Each team has their own **JIRA and Trello Board** so ping them if you want more information!

- AWS Backend: Focus on developing services for every application.
- QuickCheck: Developing a mobile application to perform vision screening.
- Toolbox Refactoring: Focus on a set of tools defined by Dr. Pearson.
- VR: A virtual reality application for detecting and treating Strabismus.
- Gamification: Currently a sub team for VR Team. To make the treatment as a game in order to make it fun and engaging.
- UI/UX: Design and prototype websites and applications.
- Product/Project Manager: To facilitate weekly meetings, project status reporting, ownership of onboarding new members, implementing scrum project management methodologies.

### Work Culture
We follow a two week Sprint.  

### What's next?

Once you have on your mind which team you would like to join and which project you would like to work on, **set up a meeting with Onboarding Buddy** with the team to get more in-depth information.

## Step 3: Settle In

After your meeting with the Onboarding Buddy, make sure to read through any documentation of the team to set up your local environment.
